# Org wide templates, health files, etc. 
Org wide template and configuration files

The purpose of these files is to streamline the contributor experience and to increase the consistency between various repos within the org. 
You can find out more about this GitHub feature [here](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file).

Any file or setting that is configured here, can be overwritten for individual repos. If you want to have a modified `bug_report.md`, simply include a file of the same name within the same path as here, inside your local repo  `.github/` folder (which should be on the root level).
